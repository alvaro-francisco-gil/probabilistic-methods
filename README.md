## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

The project is organized into two main parts:

1. **Library Code** (`src/`): Contains the core functionality for analyzing graph independence relationships.
2. **Exercises** (`exercises/`): Contains exercise solutions and notebooks.

To run the exercise solutions:
```bash
python exercises/exercise1_solution.py
```
